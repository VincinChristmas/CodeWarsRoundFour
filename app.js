Coding in function tailAndHead. function accept 1 parameter arr(a number array).

We use an example to explain this task:

You got an array [123,456,789,12,34,56,78].

First, from left to right, the tail of an element and the head of the next element are added together. The results are put into an array. like this:

[123,456,789,1 2,3 4,5 6,78]
   3+4 6+7 9+1 2+3 4+5 6+7  
    |   |   |   |   |   |
   [7 ,13 ,10 , 5 , 9 ,13]
And then, Calculate their product and return it(7x13x10x5x9x13=532350)

So, tailAndHead([123,456,789,12,34,56,78]) should return 532350 

All elements of arr are positive integer. If a number is less than 10, its head and tail are the same. Please try to use reduce() solve this kata.

Examples
tailAndHead([1,2,3,4,5]) should return 945
tailAndHead([111,2345,66,78,900]) should return 7293
tailAndHead([35456,782,569,2454,875]) should return 12012
*/                       

//MY SOLUTION
function tailAndHead(arr){
  let fixedArr = []
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    fixedArr.push(arr[i].toString())
  }
   let thisCollection = []
 for (let i = 1; i < fixedArr.length; i++) {
    thisCollection.push(Number(fixedArr[i-1][fixedArr[i-1].length-1]) + Number(fixedArr[i][0]))
  }

Everybody has probably heard of the animal heads and legs problem from the earlier years at school. It goes:

“A farm contains chickens and cows. There are x heads and y legs. How many chickens and cows are there?” 

Where x <= 1000 and y <=1000

#Task

Assuming there are no other types of animals, work out how many of each animal are there.

Return a tuple in Python - (chickens, cows) and an array list - [chickens, cows]/{chickens, cows} in all other languages

If either the heads & legs is negative, the result of your calculation is negative or the calculation is a float return "No solutions" (no valid cases), or [-1, -1] in COBOL.

If/else syntax debug
While making a game, your partner, Greg, decided to create a function to check if the user is still alive called checkAlive/CheckAlive/check_alive. Unfortunately, Greg made some errors while creating the function.

checkAlive/CheckAlive/check_alive should return true if the player's health is greater than 0 or false if it is 0 or below.

The function receives one parameter health which will always be a whole number between -10 and 10.
